I worked on a complete SQL-only project using a global education dataset. The goal was to analyze the cost of studying in different countries, cities, and universities.
I used SQL to answer real questions like:
What are the most and least expensive programs?
Which cities and countries have high tuition or living costs?
How does the rent in a city compare to the national average?

I also created:
𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 to calculate total costs
𝐓𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐬 to check data quality (like visa fee or tuition limits)
𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐓𝐄𝐬 for clean reporting
𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 to improve speed
𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥-𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 to quickly find programs by keyword

Usually, I used to just write queries for analysis. But now, I’ve started focusing on 𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒐𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒛𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 too. I try different solutions for the same analysis — with or without CTEs, using 𝑱𝑶𝑰𝑵 strategies, adding indexes on the right columns, avoiding 𝑺𝑬𝑳𝑬𝑪𝑻 *, and making my queries more efficient overall.
This project helped me practice almost everything in SQL — and I really enjoyed building it from scratch.
