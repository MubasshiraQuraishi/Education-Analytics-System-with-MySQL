I worked on a complete SQL-only project using a global education dataset. The goal was to analyze the cost of studying in different countries, cities, and universities.

I used SQL to answer real questions like:

* What are the most and least expensive programs?
* Which cities and countries have high tuition or living costs?
* How does the rent in a city compare to the national average?

I also created:

* **Stored procedures and functions** to calculate total costs
* **Triggers** to check data quality (like visa fee or tuition limits)
* **Views and CTEs** for clean reporting
* **Indexes** and **temporary tables** to improve speed
* **Full-text search** to quickly find programs by keyword

Usually, I used to just write queries for analysis. But now, I’ve started focusing on **query optimization** too. I try different solutions for the same analysis — with or without CTEs, using `JOIN` strategies, adding indexes on the right columns, avoiding `SELECT *`, and making my queries more efficient overall.

This project helped me practice almost everything in SQL — and I really enjoyed building it from scratch.
